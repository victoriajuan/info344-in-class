//CityHandler is an HTTP handler that returns zip codes
//for a given city name. It requires a ZipIndex from
//city name (lower-case) to a ZipSlice, as well as
//a PathPrefix, which is the resource path prefix (e.g., "/zips/"")
type CityHandler struct {
	PathPrefix string

//ServeHTTP handles HTTP requests for the CityHandler. This is a method
//of the CityHandler struct defined above. Methods in Go use a receiver
//parameter defined on the left, which will be an instance of the struct.
//The receiver parameter is exactly like the `this` pointer in Java, just
//more explicitly defined. For more details on receiver parameters, see
//https://drstearns.github.io/tutorials/golang/#secreceivers

	//just the characters that follow that PathPrefix

		http.Error(w, "please provide a city name", http.StatusBadRequest)
		//since http.Error() writes a response, we should return to
		//stop processing this request.
